## Reasons for migrating

Originally, I used AcademicPages as my Jekyll theme. However, I found that it lacked some features that I wanted, such as a search bar and a table of contents. I also found that the AcademicPages theme is not well-maintained, and I had to manually update the theme to get the latest features. Therefore, I decided to migrate to the Minimal Mistakes theme, which is forked by AcademicPages, so it would still have the same look and feel as the AcademicPages theme, but with more features and better maintenance.

## How I migrated

I followed the instructions on the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/) website. I forked the repository, renamed it to `fluffy-waffles` (github suggester name), and enabled GitHub Pages. I then followed the instructions to customize my website. I also followed the instructions to set up a blog.
