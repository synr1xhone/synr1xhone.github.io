Welcome! I am an undergraduate student at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/) studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I am currently at my fourth year of undergraduate studies at the [Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/), after which I plan to pursue a Master's degree in Computer Science. My interests include machine learning, cybersecurity, and software engineering. I am currently working as an undergraduate course assistant (UCA) for [CICS 256: Make: A Hands-on Introduction to Physical Computing](https://sites.google.com/view/cics256/home).

In my free time, I like to workout, cook, or binge-watch TV shows (currently watching [BCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Call_Saul)). I also enjoy working on random projects, such as hosting a JellyFin Server on my Raspberry Pi, or building this website using Jekyll and GitHub Pages.
