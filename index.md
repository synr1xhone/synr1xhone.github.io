Welcome! I am a student at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/) pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science from the [Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/). My interests include machine learning, networking, cybersecurity, and software engineering. I received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/) in 2024, where I also worked as an undergraduate course assistant (UCA) for [CICS 256: Make: A Hands-on Introduction to Physical Computing](https://sites.google.com/view/cics256/home) as well as [CS377: Operating Systems](https://github.com/umass-cs-377/377-F22).

In my free time, I like to workout, cook, or binge-watch TV shows (currently watching [Attack on Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan)). I also enjoy working on random projects, such as hosting a home-server on a laptop ([more info here](/blog/gserve/)) and creating a movie recommendation system for [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) ([more info here](/blog/jellyrec/)).

Checkout my [resume](/assets/files/resume.pdf) for more information about me.
